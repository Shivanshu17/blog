You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].


Data scientists, like software developers, implement tools using computer code. However, unlike software developers, data scientists do not typically receive a proper training on good practices and effective tools to collaborate and build products.

This guide attempts to merge the gap that data scientists may have in software development practices. We will look at a data science workflow in Python that adapts ideas from software development that ease collaborations and keeps a project in a state that is easy to productionise.

At the core of the data science workflow presented in this guide is an adaptation of the feature development and refactoring cycle which is typical of software development. In the software development cycle, new features are added to the code base and the code base is refactored to be simpler, more intuitive and more stable. In data science, data exploration takes the role of feature development. With this analogy, the data science cycle loops through data exploration and refactoring.
